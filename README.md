Shouts to https://github.com/deniszholob for the train stops.

Train signals now have their RGB value appended to the end of the stop name. **EG: Color-[:wine_glass:]-Red-Automation-Science-Pack 255 50 50**

Added trains, wagons, and fluid wagons. Train and wagon color is blueprintable, fluid wagon is not.  

Added active requester chests (blue) and active requester storehouses (blue) [from https://github.com/Warehousing/Warehousing] for visuial indicators.

**Protip:** Shift+RMB a wagon and you can Shift+LMB that wagon's color to a train without changing anything else about the train.

**Don't manually color trains.** Use https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Automatic_Train_Painter
